# Assembly-Emulator
C program that emulates assembly and runs based off of arrays with programs converted to hexadecimal.

# How The Program Works
Program contains methods in C that represent well known assembly commands.
Program runs based off of an array in main that contains assembly code converted to hexadecimal.
By manipulating bits and using if statements, the hexadecimal is translated and refers to the assembly commands coded in the program.
Each assembly command is then executed and the result can be seen in the output of the terminal.

# Current Instruction Sets
Currently there is a commented out hexadecimal array for a fibonacci program and a program that performs 2*3.
Uncommented there is a program that runs conways game of life with user input for how many gens you want.
